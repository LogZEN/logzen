      <h1>Welcome to LogZen</h1>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        LogZen is a next-generation web-based Syslog viewer. It uses an 
        elasticsearch backend to store syslog messages allowing you to 
        search very efficienty through millions of events. A customizable 
        dashboard allows you to display the most important information at 
        a glance.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Initial configuration</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        Before you will be able to use this software, an initial configuration
        is needed. LogZen uses configuration files to store its settings 
        and user information. The syntax of these configuration files is very 
        simple. They can have multiple sections where each section can have 
        multiple Key-Value pairs. Comments start with a semicolon and empty 
        lines are ignored.
      </p>
      <pre>
[section] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &larr; a section
key = value &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &larr; a key-value pair
bla = blubb &nbsp; ; comment &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &larr; a key-value pair followed by a comment
;comment &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &larr; a comment
</pre>
      <br />
      
      <p>
        To get started have a look at the <i>config</i> directory inside your
        LogZen installation. The configuration files you will find there are:
      </p>
      <table class="table table-bordered">
        <tr>
          <td>cherrypy.conf</td>
          <td>Webserver settings - the address and port number to listen on</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>logzen.conf</td>
          <td>LogZen configuration - syslog backend configuration</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>users.conf</td>
          <td>LogZen users - users that are allowed to login</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      
      <h2>Adding a user</h2>
      <p>
        Before you will be able to login, you must create a user. Users are stored
        in the configuration file users.conf. The name of a user must be set as 
        a section name. The only key-value pair the section owns is the users
        password.
      </p>
      <p>
        Passwords are stored as sha256 hashes. You can use the user 
        creation form to generate a user section and hashed password.
      </p>
      <a href="#system/adduser" class="btn btn-primary input-large">Create a user</a>
            
      <h2>What now?</h2>
      <p>
        After you have finished the configuration, set <i>configured = True</i>
        in your <i>logzen.conf</i> configuration file and restart the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have fun.
