      <h1>Welcome to pyLogView</h1>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        pyLogView is a next-generation web-based syslog viewer. 
        It currently supports displaying and searching through syslog 
        messages stored in a postgresql database. A dashboard allows you
        to display nice-looking statistics as well as the latest events. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Initial configuration</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        Before you will be able to use this software, an initial configuration
        is needed. PyLogView uses configuration files to store it's settings 
        and user information. The syntax of these configuration files is very 
        simple. They can have multiple sections where each section can have 
        multiple Key-Value pairs. Comments start with a semicolon and empty 
        lines are ignored.
      </p>
      <pre>
[section] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &larr; a section
key = value &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &larr; a key-value pair
bla = blubb &nbsp; ; comment &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &larr; a key-value pair followed by a comment
;comment &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &larr; a comment
</pre>
      <br />
      
      <p>
        To get started have a look at the <i>config</i> directory inside your
        pyLogView installation. The configuration files you will find there are:
      </p>
      <table class="table table-bordered">
        <tr>
          <td>cherrypy.conf</td>
          <td>Webserver settings - the address and port number to listen on</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>logview.conf</td>
          <td>pyLogView configuration - syslog backend configuration</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>users.conf</td>
          <td>pyLogView users - users that are allowed to login</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      
      <h2>Adding a user</h2>
      <p>
        Before you are able to login, you must create a user. Users are stored
        in the configuration file users.conf. The name of a user must be set as 
        a section name. The only key-value pair the section owns is the users
        password.
      </p>
      <p>
        Passwords are stored in form of a sha256 hash. You can use the user 
        creation form to generate a user section and hashed password.
      </p>
      <a href="/help/create_user?backlink=1" class="btn btn-primary input-large">Create a user</a>
            
      <h2>Starting over</h2>
      <p>
        After you have finished the configuration, set <i>configured = True</i>
        in your <i>logview.conf</i> configuration file and restart the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have fun.
