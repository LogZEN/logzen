        <p>
          pyLogView is a next-generation web-based syslog viewer.<br />
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
          It uses an elasticsearch backend to store syslog messages allowing
          you to search very efficienty through millions of events.
          A customizable dashboard allows you to display the most important 
          information at a glance. By evaluating similar events we allow you
          to recognize the most important log messages, detect root cases and
          get a new view of the events in your network.  
        </p>
